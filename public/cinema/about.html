              <h2>How it works</h2>
              <p>The <a href="/cinema">cinema</a> page will show you 5 shots at random. If you wish to see 5 new—random—shots, simply reload the page. HTML5 video does not work on
                mobile so if you're on mobile you'll just be seeing 5 stills. I store all the videos by number (1.mp4,2.mp4,3.mp4,...,n.mp4) and keep their information (like the rough date at which I shot them)
                in a corresponding JSON file. To load 5 of them at random, I create an array of values [1,2,3,...,n] and then perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fisher-Yates shuffle</a>
                on the array and take the first 5 values which will correspond to the 5 videos that are loaded.</p>

              <h2>Selection</h2>
              <p>All of the shots on the <a href="cinema.html">cinema</a> page, and any where else on this website for that matter, are my own. I shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH5. The amount of total possible shots on the page
              is not static; I would like to add at least 100 shots.</p>

              <h2>Compression</h2>
              <p>In order for your browser to load 5 FHD videos in a reasonable amount of time I must compress them quite heavily. The shots are typically around
                10 seconds in length and I compress them to be under 5MB. The raw video files I shoot can have bitrates of up to 400MB/s. Most
                of the shots I shoot in 59.94 FPS and I slow down to 23.97 FPS in post leaving a raw bitrate of about 160 MB/s (1.6 GB per 10 seconds). This
                means I am compressing the shots, in terms of bitrate, by about 99.5%. The raw videos are shot in 59.94 FPS at 4K while I export at 23.97 FPS at 1080p
                which does help, but not enough to not need to compress the videos further. If HTML5 supported the HEVC (h.265) codec I would be able to upload much higher
                quality version of my shots at a much lower bitrate, but the best option right now is the h.264 codec. At some point I would like to create a way for the user
                (you) to access the raw video files for each of the shots if you so please, but right now I don't have anything like that set up.</p>
